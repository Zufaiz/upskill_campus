Weeds are unwanted crops that we want to get rid of. To get rid of weeds in our fields, we can spray pesticides. 
First and foremost we need to identify the weed. Then spray the correct pesticide. We need to buy pesticides after carefully  reading the instructions and important information written on the label.
We should use right equipment for spraying the pesticides. 
There are weather conditions that need to be taken care of as well.
Take precautions and monitor the treated field.
After taking necessary measures, the other crops are less likely to be affected badly due to pest spray.
